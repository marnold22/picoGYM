# TITLE: picoGym Practice Challenges

This is a repository that holds all my notes, code, and challenge files for the picoGym practice problems.

It is broken into these categories

1. Binary Exploitation
2. Cryptography
3. Forensics
4. General Skills
5. Reverse Engineering
6. Web Exploitation

UPDATE: 8-12-2022

~~There is also a "in-progress" folder which holds my notes, code, and challeng files for unsolved problems that are still "work in progress"~~

This structure is no longer used, each challenge is created in its subsequent parent folder.
