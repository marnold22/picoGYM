Description: If I told you a word started with 0x70 in hexadecimal, what would it start with in ASCII?

Hint-1: Submit your answer in our flag format. For example, if your answer was 'hello', you would submit 'picoCTF{hello}' as the flag.

Created flag.py which strips the first two characters "0x" off and then decodes the hex value.
