Description: What is 0x3D (base 16) in decimal (base 10)?

Hint-1: Submit your answer in our flag format. For example, if your answer was '22', you would submit 'picoCTF{22}' as the flag.

Ran flag.py to convert the already base 16 value into a decimal value (base 10) using the built in int() function
