Description: This file has a flag in plain sight (aka "in-the-clear").

Hint-1: Any hints about entering a command into the Terminal (such as the next one), will start with a '$'... everything after the dollar sign will be typed (or copy and pasted) into your Terminal.
Hint-2: To get the file accessible in your shell, enter the following in the Terminal prompt: `$ wget https://mercury.picoctf.net/static/704f877da185904ec3992e7255a15c6c/flag`
Hint-3: `$ man cat`
