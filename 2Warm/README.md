## FLAG: picoCTF{}

## Status: Incomplete

Category: General-Skills

Description: Can you convert the number 42 (base 10) to binary (base 2)?

Hint-1: Submit your answer in our competition's flag format. For example, if your answer was '11111', you would submit 'picoCTF{11111}' as the flag.

Using the bin() function in python we can convert normal decimal values to binary

HOWEVER! Need to remember to remove the '0b' prefix - which denotes 'bits' to get the correct flag
