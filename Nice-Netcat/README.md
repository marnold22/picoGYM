Description: There is a nice program that you can talk to by using this command in a shell: $ nc mercury.picoctf.net 7449 but it doesn't speak English

> nc mercury.picoctf.net 7449
> nc mercury.picoctf.net 7449 > response

Then need to run getFlag.py which converts list of ascii values into characters
